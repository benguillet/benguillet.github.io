Hi!

I am a Software Engineer from France at [Remind](https://www.remind.com). Graduate of the [University of Technology of Belfort-Montb√©liard](http://www.utbm.fr/) (France), and former student at [St. Olaf College](http://www.stolaf.edu/), MN.

I have solid programming skills on various languages ranging from low to high level, such as C, C++, Ruby, Go or Javascript and a good adaptation ability to new languages and concepts.

I am interested in Web development (back-end, messaging, APIs creation) and devops.
